# Investigating Covid-19 Virus Trends
We are going to investigate the trends for covid-19 for a data that was collected from January 2020 to July 2020. We understand that this is not a full dataset as covid-19 has been recking havock for quite a number of years but our analysis will solely focus on those years.
